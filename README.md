<u>**MT7610U for Linux**</u>

Tested with latest -stable, v4.15.6

Driver for 802.11ac USB Adapter with  
MT7610U/MT7630u/MT7650u chipset  
Only STA/Monitor Mode is supported, no AP.  

<u>At least v4.0 is needed to compile this module</u>  
sorry people with older kernels, the code is removed.

Currently tested on X86_64 platform(s) **only**,  
cross compile possible.

> **Tested on**
>> Ubuntu 14, 16 and 18


For compiling type  
`make`  
in source dir  

To install the firmware files  
`sudo make installfw`

> __HENRIQUE ADDED:__
>> For install the driver use  
```bash
sudo modprobe cfg80211
sudo insmod mt7610u.ko
```


To Unload driver you may need to disconnect the device  

If the driver fails building consult your distro how to  
install the kernel sources and build an <u>external</u> module.
  
Questions about this will **silently** ignored !  
They are <u>plenty</u> information around the web.  

**NOTES**  

The original driver is **PITA**  
Both mt7610u and mt7612u <u>can</u> work with the same driver.  
**but currently dont't**  

Code which is missing in one driver, may found in the other driver.  
i.e STA, AP, Monitor, RSSI, LED handling stuff  

**STATUS**  
Driver works fine (some sort of)  
Most of the work is done is cleaning the driver and make this mess **readable**   for conversion.  
Updates for wireless-ext/cfg80211  are not accepted.  
The only solution is uptream and this is mac80211 support.  

**NOTES for an/ac only devices (5GHz)**  

Sitecom, Develo and TP-LLink released a 5GHz **only** device  
`0x7392:0xc711 Devolo Wifi ac Stick`  
`0x0df6:0x0079 Sitecom Europe B.V. ac  Stick`  
`0x2357:0x0105 TP-LINK Archer T1U`  
which are also supported, but currenty the driver will  
scan the missing 2.4GHz band too.  
  
**BUGS**  
- remove stupid endianess with device descriptors  
- fix 5GHz only device  
- fix unloading driver (fixed ?)  
- do more function typesafe  
- check for wrong typecasts  
- remove/strip hardcoded `RT2870STA.dat`  
- check for wrong variable sizes (driver was for 32bit)  
- update to more USB-IDs  
- check if monitor mode is working  
- more cleanup and other stuff  
- fix compile warnings  
- misc. other stuff
